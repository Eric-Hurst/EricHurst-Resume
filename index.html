        <div class="subheading mb-5">MarketingðŸ“ˆ</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I was born and raised in Concord, California, about 30 minutes east of San Francisco. I lived my entire life in the Bay Area, before moving to Southern California in the fall of 2019 to begin college at the University of California Riverside. Due to the current Coronavirus pandemic, Iâ€™ve been forced to relocate back to the Bay Area but plan to return to Riverside in October 2020. From a young age, I have always had an interest in marketing and advertising after being introduced to it by my father. After seeing his hundreds of slides of PowerPoint presentations and his countless Excel sheets, Iâ€™ve been intrigued at the concept of market research. The idea of pinpointing markets and products is fascinating, and a field I believe has a role in every business. Being exposed to the field at such a young age has allowed me to learn as much as possible about the subject, and I even occasionally help my dad with some of his projects when he is overloaded. <br><br>

        Iâ€™ve had experience in positions of leadership, beginning my senior year of high school when I was appointed captain of the cross country team. I was in charge of around 60 athletes and ensuring that everyone was where they needed to be and doing what they were supposed to do. This is an achievement that I am quite proud of, as learning how to be an effective leader was not an easy task, but certainly a rewarding one. While I may not have known what I was doing at the beginning of the season, by the year's end I feel I had matured and grown to the point where I was the best leader I could possibly be. Making such a large team feel like a family is a task that took lots of hard work and many hiccups, but in the end it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. I also spent high school volunteering at my local food bank, where I learned valuable communication skills. At the food bank I had to work with lots of different people from all kinds of backgrounds, so I was forced to learn how to effectively work and bond with them. These skills have transferred to my work experience as well, as being able to work with all kinds of people has been a strength of mine. <br><br>

        While I am currently unemployed, I am looking to continue working again this summer once the coronavirus pandemic calms down. After that, I am excited to return to UC Riverside to continue my second year studies in the fall.
